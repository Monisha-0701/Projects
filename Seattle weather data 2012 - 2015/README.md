# Analysing Seattle Weather from 2012 - 2015

This project involves working with a dataset containing weather information for Seattle from the year 2012 to 2015. The dataset include various weather related variables such as date,  precipitation, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, wind and weather. The primary goal is to gain insights into the weather patterns and trends during this four-year period.

## Documentation
I have obtained the dataset from Kaggle and have prepared the data by calculating "Average temperature" in the 'working_data' sheet.  I have analysed Yearly, Monthly and Seasonal Trends under 'Average_Temperature_by_month', 'Total_Precipitation_by_Year', 'Weather Events Frequency'. Also, I have done correlation analysis by investigating the relationship between Temperature and Percipitation variable. Finally, I created a Dashboard to present all the analysis and visualisation which explain the insights that I have gathered.
